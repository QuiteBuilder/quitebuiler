# Multi-Layer Data Pipeline Architecture Pattern

## Part 1: "The Architecture Overview"
  - The problem this solves
  - High-level architecture diagram
  - Why message-driven over direct calls
  - When to use this pattern vs simpler approaches

## Part 2: "Schedulers & Message Bus Design"
  - Timer-based job scheduling patterns
  - Queue vs Topic routing strategies
  - Message design (pagination markers, circuit breakers)
  - Dead letter handling

## Part 3: "The Mining Layer: Authenticated API Extraction"
  - Per-user client isolation patterns
  - Self-scheduling pagination
  - Rate limiting and proxy rotation
  - Error handling and retry policies

## Part 4: "Processing & Transformation Patterns"
  - Dual-layer caching (Redis + Database)
  - Batch processing and time partitioning
  - Smart termination algorithms
  - Data transformation pipelines

## Part 5: "Checkpoint Systems: Making It Bulletproof"
  - Content-based deduplication
  - Resumable operations design
  - Multi-source tracking patterns
  - Performance vs reliability trade-offs

## Part 6: "Dual HTTP/WebSocket Strategy"
  - Why you need both approaches
  - WebSocket connection management
  - Real-time processing pipelines
  - Resource management patterns

## Part 7: "Production Lessons & Scaling Strategies"
  - Performance bottlenecks we discovered
  - Monitoring and observability
  - Cost optimization techniques
  - When this pattern breaks down
