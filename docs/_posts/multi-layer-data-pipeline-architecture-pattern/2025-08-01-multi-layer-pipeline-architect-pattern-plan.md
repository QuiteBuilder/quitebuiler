# Building a Multi-Layer Data Pipeline Architecture: Complete Technical Series

**A comprehensive 7-part guide to building production-grade, scalable data extraction systems using Azure Functions, Service Bus, and .NET 8.**

---

## About This Series

This blog series explores architectural patterns for building large-scale data extraction systems. Using a Facebook analytics platform as our example scenario, we'll walk through the complete design and implementation of a system that can handle millions of API calls daily across hundreds of users with 99.9% reliability. These patterns apply broadly to any multi-tenant data extraction system.

## Technical Foundation

- **Platform**: Azure Functions with .NET 8
- **Message Bus**: Azure Service Bus (queues & topics)
- **Database**: SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
- **Caching**: Redis with FusionCache
- **Real-time**: WebSockets and SignalR
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights and structured logging

## About the Author

This series explores patterns for building production data extraction systems through the lens of a Facebook analytics platform. The architectural lessons come from general distributed systems experience and common patterns used in large-scale API integration projects.

The examples demonstrate systems that can handle:
- 500+ concurrent users with independent authentication
- 2M+ API calls per day across multiple endpoints
- 99.9% data accuracy with zero duplicate processing
- Sub-minute recovery from complete system failures

These are realistic targets for any large-scale data extraction system.
